# **Crazy Gear**

This is more than a game. It is a philosophy of life.

There should be always a plan to map and overcome obstacles. The best would be to turn them into real opportunities. This forms the mindset of the player.

**Adaptability**
Crazy gear is facing obstacles of 3 different shapes, the player should expose each time the right shape to the obstacles.

**Letting go**
Some of the obstacles are not necessary to face and the player should just let them go !

**Visualisation**
While avoiding or facing obstacles, the player should visualize and update its calculations to make the obstacles form a sequence of winning configuration. The player and the gear are looking for arithmetic and geometric sequences using collected obstacles. It looks like experience !

**Resiliance** 
The gear has a certain level of structure integrity. It will be broken if it stays inactive or if it faces obstacles without any strategy to score !

## How to play

    1. Use the arrows to move right, left, up and down
    2. Right-click to rotate clockwise and left-click to rotate anticlockwise !
    3. Catch the falling obstacles with the right cavity shape oriented to the top.
    4. The gear has limitless capacity to store the collected obstacles
    5. If the counts of collected figures form an arithmetic sequence, you score twice the total number of figures
    6. If the counts of collected figures form a geometric sequence, you score 3 times the total number of figures
    7. The gear empties its collection of obstacles when you score.

## How to contribute and make it better

Please reach out and we can discuss such topics and others :

- Trigonometry to adjust the position of catched obstacles.
- UX to make it more intuitive. The gear should visualy send the obstacles to the score board once it's full ! This will be more realistic.
- Challenges to reach certain goals.
- Time pressure.
- Adding coins and bonus.
- Multi-player on same board.
- Adding Missions.
- CSS enhancements and mobile version.
- Multi-shape and colors to diversify missions.
- ...
